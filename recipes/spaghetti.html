        <p>
            No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true
            to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices
            to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you
            don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My
            advice? Do it perfectly.
