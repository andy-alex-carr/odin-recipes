        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This special homemade lasagna recipe comes with a meaty,
            made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A
            more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta
            but this recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and
            Parmesan. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
