        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Ravioli is the most famous and traditional stuffed pasta. They are
            those that have a square shape and are usually filled with meat. As
            a curiosity, ravioli were already served in a papal conclave in the
            16th century and were filled with bacon: bocato di cardinale!

            The most common thing is to go eat them at a restaurant or buy them
            already filled, but what about trying to make them yourself? This
            particular recipe is to prepare a ravioli dish with ricotta,
            parmesan and ham.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                For the dough we mix 100 grams of wheat flour and 1 egg. We
                knead everything until we have a smooth and spongy dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, with the help of a rolling pin, we stretch the dough and
                give it the shape of a ravioli.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the filling, we cut the cheese, ham and arugula well, we
                stir to try to keep the quantities of each tortellini equal and
                with the help of a teaspoon we put a little of the mixture into
                each pasta. Then we seal with another piece as if it were a
                dumpling.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, cook it for a few minutes in a boiling pot. Normally
                when the pasta stays afloat it will be ready.
